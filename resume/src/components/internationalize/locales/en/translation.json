  "aboutMe_body": "I am a proudly graduate from ESCOM IPN, I am a technology enthusiast that is always trying new things, specially if it is about GNU/Linux and free software, I am not married with just using it, but I prefer it over others. I love learning about almost everything, and I also like to share my knowledge with others because teach is like learn it twice, since I was a college student I was a web programmer, and it is one of my favorite development areas because it is actually a way to provide multi platform software. In my freetime I really enjoy to listening music, doing workout, playing videogames at night, watching anime, movies, etc."
