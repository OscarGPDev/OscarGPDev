I love learning about almost everything, and I also like to share my knowledge with others because teach is like learn it twice, since I was a college student I was a web programmer, and it is one of my favorite development areas because it is actually a way to provide multi platform software. In my free time I really enjoy to listening music, doing workout, playing video games at night, watching anime, movies, etc.",
