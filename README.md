Hi! I'm Oscar, a full stack developer nowadays working as a front end. 
## About me
I'm a full stack developer who works as a front end but still going further trying new technologies and so on.

At work and even out I'm the dude you call when you're stuck. I feel proud of that, I think it is the kind of thing that proves I'm skilled but also nice to work with.

Currently, I'm getting back on track on my way to improving my skills.

I am a proudly graduate:mortar_board: from ESCOM IPN, I am a technology enthusiast that is always trying new things, specially if it is about GNU/Linux, I am not an extremist, but I prefer Free Software over privative.

I love learning about almost everything, and I also like to share my knowledge with others because teach is like learn it twice, since I was a college student I was a web programmer, and it is one of my favorite development areas because it is actually a way to provide multi platform software.

In my freetime I really enjoy to listening music, doing workout, playing videogames, watching anime, movies, etc.

## About my skills
As a programmer I know some languages and frameworks as you can see in the following json, and also as I have said I am a self-learning lover.
