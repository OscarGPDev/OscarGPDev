Hi! I'm Oscar, a systems engineer in process. I love GNU/Linux :penguin:, and I am a programmer too. 
## About me
I am a proudly graduate:mortar_board: from ESCOM IPN, I am a technology enthusiast that is always trying new things, specially if it is about GNU/Linux, I am not an extremist, but I prefer Free Software over privative.

I love learning about almost everything, and I also like to share my knowledge with others because teach is like learn it twice, since I was a college student I was a web programmer, and it is one of my favorite development areas because it is actually a way to provide multi platform software.

In my freetime I really enjoy to listening music, doing workout, playing videogames, watching anime, movies, etc.

## About my skills
As a programmer I know some languages and frameworks as you can see in the following json, and also as I have said I am a self-learning lover.

```
{
  "python": [
    "Django", 
    "Django-rest-framework"
    ],
  "csharp": [
    "ASP.NET Framework", 
    "ASP.NET Core", 
    "SOAP and REST projects"
    ],
  "javascript": [
    "Node.js with express",
    "React",
    "Currently learning Angular, Vue.js and Electron"
  ],
  "java": "Currently I made java applications in college but with old versions, actually I have made Android apps with java but it was quite long ago"
}
```

## About my life skills
I'm kind, a nice dude I think. I know that as a part of a team, or even society, I must socialize with others and I can do that well, I believe that a warm and respectful comunication it's a cornerstone.

### What about languages?
As I said before, I like self learning, recently I started to learn languages.
- English: My principal skills became from reading(I'm a docs guy) and music, **BUT** I'm currently learning in CENLEX IPN in order to achive the B2 in MCER metrics.
- Russian: I'm currently learning Russian via Duolingo, I'm in Diamond league :gem: and once I finish the 4 section I would like to learn Japanese too.
- Spanish: I'm mexican, it's my mother language.
