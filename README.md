I am Oscar, a systems engineer in process. I love GNU/Linux, and I am a programmer too.
## About me
I am a proudly graduate from ESCOM IPN, I am a technology enthusiast that is always trying new things, specially if it is about GNU/Linux, I am not married with just using it, but I prefer it over others.

I love learning about almost everything, and I also like to share my knowledge with others because teach is like learn it twice, since I was a college student I was a web programmer, and it is one of my favorite development areas because it is actually a way to provide multi platform software.

In my freetime I really enjoy to listening music, doing workout, playing videogames at night, watching anime, movies, etc.

## About my skills
As a programmer I know some languages and frameworks as you can see in the following json, and also as I have said I am a self-learning lover.
